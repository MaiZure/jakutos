# jakutos
Project Jakutos is a Roguelike that I'm writing to learn JavaScript. I've decided to use Might and Magic 6 as the model for this project.

The current master branch is playable directly on [GitHub Pages][reference-id-for-github-pages]
[reference-id-for-github-pages]:http://maizure.github.io/jakutos/

Implemented controls are as follows:

Arrows for 4-direction movement

M for the minimap (includes the whole MM6 main world)

\+ and \- for zooming in and out

All you can do right now is run in to monsters to fight.

v0.3 branch in progress with quite a few more features.

Roadmap forthcoming
