Need to slow down monster attacks a bit (they attack every turn!)

Make move turn PQ
Make diagonal movement
Make some of the older objects more JS-like
Make interface for setting variables/dirty (especially HUD with heirarchy)

Fill out monsters

BUG: Message window doesn't update immediately on ranged hit
BUG: Ranged attack range doesn't scale with view...great bug!
BUG: Chasing monsters shoot at player regardless of range

REFACTOR: Split the Party object in to party member objects
REFACTOR: Streamline object heirarchy and interfaces (less coupling)
REFACTOR: Generalize casting to merge monsters/Players/effects
