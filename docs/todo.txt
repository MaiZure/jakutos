Hover over avatar for name/class
Ranged attacks for monsters
Add stun effects to hopefully counter aggression
Need to slow down monster attacks a bit (they attack every turn!)

Make move turn PQ
Make diagonal movement
Make some of the older objects more JS-like
Make interface for setting dirty (especially in HUD with heirarchy)

Fill out monsters

BUG: Message window doesn't update immediately on ranged hit

BUG: Ranged attack range doesn't scale with view...great bug!

REFACTOR: Split the Party object in to party member objects
