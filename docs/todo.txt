Need to slow down monster attacks a bit (they attack every turn!)
Need to rework the die_roll function across all attacks
Need to streamline the monster/player skill references for damage
Need to incorporate dual wielding and multiple rings in to wearing
Need to get stats and modifiers in to items
Need to refactor Minimap in to object form.

Make move turn PQ
Make diagonal movement
Make some of the older objects more JS-like
Make interface for setting variables/dirty (especially HUD with heirarchy)

Fill out monsters

BUG: Message window doesn't update immediately on ranged hit
BUG: Ranged attack range doesn't scale with view...great bug!
BUG: Chasing monsters shoot at player regardless of range
BUG: Monster threats are loaded at step 1 (of course player should never have threats in their face on step 1 so...not exactly a bug)

REFACTOR: Streamline object heirarchy and interfaces (less coupling)
REFACTOR: Generalize casting to merge monsters/Players/effects
REFACTOR: Message box and inventory box need a common ancestor object
